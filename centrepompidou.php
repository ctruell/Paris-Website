		<p class="par" id="one">In 1969, President Georges Pompidou decided that "multidisciplinary cultural centre of a new type" should be created in Paris. This lead to many different project ideas which later became the Centre Pompidou. An internation competition was held to decide who would design the building. The winners were Richard Rogers, a Brit, Renzo Piano and Gianfranco Franchini, two Italians. It first opened on February 2nd, 1977 and it was an immediate success. During the late 70s and 80s the museum housed many infuential modern art exhibits. It was reorganized in 1992 and from October 1997 to December 1999. The reopening on January 1st 2000 was also a huge success. Now the museum welcomes 3.5 to 3.8 million visitors a year.</p>
