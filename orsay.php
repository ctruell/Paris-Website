		<p class="par" id="one">Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay was formerly called Gare d'Orsay and was a train station and hotel. The station was build on the site of the ruined Palais d'Orsay which was burnt down during the civil war in the late 19th century. The station was built during the turn of the 20th century. The train station was seldom used after 1939 because new, longer trains could not fit on to the platoform. In 1973, the hotel closed. In 1977, the governement decided to make the old station a museum and the building became a historical monument in 1978. The museum opened on December 9th, 1986.</p>
